    <p>Extras casting directors book background performers on many criteria but primarily appearance. Current pictures of you are a must.

Feel free to submit as many different pictures of yourself. Here are some photo guidelines and suggestions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No busy backgrounds &ndash; i.e. furniture, trees and plants, wall hangings etc.</li>
      <li>No friends &ndash; just you alone</li>
      <li>Be natural &ndash; don&rsquo;t pose</li>

      <li>Production shoot days are often 12-16 hours long. When you indicate your availability and accept a booking, keep in mind you are committing to as much time as you may be required. Ensure you are free of other commitments and obligations prior to accepting a booking. </li>
      <li>We may also call you to confirm your availability for a booking. If we are unable to reach you, we will leave a message. It is imperative you check you messages frequently and call us back ASAP.</li>
      <li>Once you have accepted a booking you are expected to fulfill your commitment.&nbsp;<br>

    <p>Please be 15-20 minutes early prior to your call time.</p>
    <p>Where you sign in on set may be located some distance from where shooting is occurring and you may need the time to get there. You may also need the time to get dressed if you are to be wearing specific wardrobe. There are also unforeseen circumstances (traffic, ahead of shooting schedule, etc) in which the extra time becomes very useful. </p>
    <p>If for any reason you are going to be late, immediately call T.A.G. (778-889-6824).</p>

      <li> Your contact person (or wrangler) signing you in will check off your name and give you a background voucher / time sheet. (See background voucher on how the form is to be completed). Fill the voucher out and hand it back to the person who signed you in. </li>
      <li>Listen carefully to what the wranglers are telling you throughout the day. They will be giving you information about what you will be doing.</li>
      <li>At the end of the day when you are &lsquo;wrapped&rsquo; the voucher will be completed. Ensure it is correct. Your contact person will give you a copy after it is completed. KEEP THE COPY! This is your record that you worked on set and also governs how much you will be paid. If there is a discrepancy or the production misplaces their copy (remember the production accounting office has literally hundreds to deal with), your copy will resolve the issue.&nbsp;<br>

    <div class="middleTitle"><a name="12">PAYMENT</a> / FEES:</div>
    <ol>
      <li>Tactical Actions Group is an agency that works off of commission. We do not get paid until you get paid. Our only fee is our commission. There are no registration fees, no photo fees, and no administration fees.    </li>
      <li>Your earnings are processed by the accounting department of the production company and is calculated from the background voucher you signed on set. Once this is completed, a cheque for your services will be sent to Tactical Actions Group. This process could take up to 2 &ndash; 3 weeks. </li>
      <li>Always keep all copies of your background vouchers. These vouchers are your record of the productions you have worked on as well as the dates and times. </li>
      <li>When Tactical Actions Group receives your cheque from the production company, we will notify you that your cheque is ready for pickup from our office. We will also advise you of the commission owed to Tactical Actions Group. </li>
      <li>Commission is 15% based on your gross pay. GST is also payable but is based on the commission, not your gross pay. </li>
      <li>At present, since you are considered to be under contract, Income Tax, CPP and E.I. are not deducted by either Tactical Actions Group or the production companies. The filing of your taxes to the CRA is your responsibility. Tactical Actions Group will not remit taxes on your behalf. </li>
      <li>You must have your commission payment with you when you pick up your cheque. You can pay your commission by either cash or cheque. We do not accept credit nor debit cards. </li>
      <li> If your commission cheque returns NSF, you will be responsible for both the commission payment and any NSF associated bank charges. You are expected to rectify the issue immediately.</li>
