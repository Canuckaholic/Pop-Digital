	  <p>One of the best ways to learn about the magic of filmmaking, share in the spotlight of movies and possibly see your favourite actors a few feet away from you is to become an extra.</p>
	  <p>Extras, also known as background performers, are people hired to provide &lsquo;people scenery&rsquo; to the main action of the film. Background performers come in all shapes and sizes, ages, and ethnicities</p>
	  <p>Extras fill the nightclubs with dancers and club goers as the main actors converse at a table in the bar. They&nbsp;can be&nbsp;the soldiers that back up the X-Men as the X-Men battle Magneto and the Brotherhood Mutants. Background performers are also those people who play the part of police officers in a police station. They are also spectators at the arena of a sporting event. Our background performers are frequently required for a variety of scenes in film and television.</p>
	  <p>Becoming an extra is easy. You can register with our agency, Tactical Actions Group (T.A.G.). It is a simple matter of filling out a form that requires a few vital statistics and a brief interview. Click on&nbsp;'<a href="/become_an_extra/register.php">Register with T.A.G.</a>'  for more details.</p>
	  <p>Being an extra can be fun and exciting but it also requires commitment and professionalism. You will need:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Cell phone</li>
	    <li>Flexible schedule</li>
	    <li>Access to a vehicle</li>
	    <li>Access to a computer</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>Once you&rsquo;ve become an extra, you&rsquo;ll get the hang of it quickly and soon you&rsquo;ll feel like a pro.</p>
