			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my experience I have often come across clients, or potential clients, who may question why they need to invest company dollars into a professionally designed and developed website (or application). After all, it is possible for a student to teach themselves the basics, download a few programs from the internet, and charge a client a few hundred dollars to build them a website. Then, as I so often see, clients wonder why their site isn&#8217;t getting any traffic, ranking on Google, or converting visitors to customers.</p>
<p>My typical response to questions on why it&#8217;s worth investing real dollars into an online presence (website, social media, mobile, web applications, etc) is that, as professionals, we aren&#8217;t just building them a website, we are building for them a user experience. We are building them a system which incorporates metrics, usability, information architecture, interface design, and managing objectives.</p>
<p>An interesting article, called <a href="www.hesketh.com/publications/user_experience.pdf">User Experience as Corporate Imperative</a>, lists some compelling stats which I would like to repeat here. The article was written in 2002 and talks about the major browsers being IE and Netscape!, but I believe that the underlying concepts are still very much applicable today.</p>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 9.8px Arial} --></p>
<ul>
<li>Approximate 60% of the time, users have difficulty finding the information they are seeking on a website.</li>
<li>Jakob Nielsen estimates that 90% of websites have poor user-centered design.</li>
<li>At the time that the article was written, it states that 28% of website transactions result in consumer failure of frustration. 35% of people who experience a negative experience on a website will leave that site for a competitors, most likely never to return. 27% of all web transactions are abandoned on the payment screen, and 75% of shoppers abandon their shopping cart without making a purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next step for me is to see if I can find some more recent statistics to see if these numbers have changed.</p>
