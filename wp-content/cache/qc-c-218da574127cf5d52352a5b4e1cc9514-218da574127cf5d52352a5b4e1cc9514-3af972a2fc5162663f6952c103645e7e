			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lev Manovich refers to the interactivity that uses fixed elements arranged in a branching structure as <em>closed</em> interactivity; interactivity where both the elements and the structure are generated dynamically in real-time based on user interaction he calls <em>open</em> interactivity (Manovich, 2001, p.40). These concepts are similar to the open/closed and emergent/embedded narrative dichotomies mentioned by other authors.</p>
<p>Marie-Laure Ryan, in her essay &#8220;Beyond Myth and Metaphor,&#8221; breaks the open/closed interactivity dichotomy down even further (Ryan, 2001). Ryan sets up two pairs of opposing concepts: internal/external interactivity, and exploratory/ontological interactivity.</p>
<ul>
<li>In      internal interactivity &#8220;the user projects himself as a member of the      fictional world&#8221; (Ryan,      2001). This can be done through an avatar, or by experiencing the world      from a first-person perspective (ex. a first-person shooter video game).      This is a form of personal perspective interactivity.</li>
<li>In      external interactivity the participant is situated outside of the virtual      world, either by playing a god-like role looking on and controlling from      above, or by navigating a database-like story structure. This is a form of      impersonal perspective interactivity that does not require a concrete      persona.</li>
<li>In      exploratory interactivity the user is free to move about the virtual      world, exploring all the details, but their activity does not affect the      overall plot in any way. The user simply reveals the story as they      explore.</li>
<li>In      ontological interactivity the decisions of the user can affect the plot,      such that the story develops from the user&#8217;s interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cross-classification of these two dichotomies leads to four combinations for categorizing interactive works. These are not listed in any particular order of effectiveness.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>External/exploratory      interactivity:</strong> Certain “classical” hypertexts fall into this category,      such the &#8220;novels&#8221; of Michael Joyce, Stuart Moulthrop, or Mark      Amerika. The user can choose paths through the virtual space, but the      space itself has no physical narrative setting. This type of interactivity      is exploratory because “the reader’s path of navigation affects not the narrative      events themselves, but only the way in which the global narrative      pattern&#8230; emerges in the mind” (Ryan,      2001).</li>
<li><strong>Internal/exploratory      interactivity:</strong> In this category, “the user takes a virtual body with      her into the fictional world, but her role in this world is limited to      actions that have no bearing on the narrative events” (Ryan,      2001). Even though the user cannot affect the plot, she is still immersed      in the narrative through a virtual body. She is present on the story’s      stage, if only as an observer. Examples of this type of interactivity are      the computer games <em>Myst, Tomb Raider</em> and <em>Final Fantasy</em>. In      these games the user plays an internal role (ex. Laura Croft in <em>Tomb Raider</em>), but the game is      structured in such a way that the user must follow a fairly linear      narrative path. Deviating from the &#8220;correct&#8221; path simply stalls      the narrative; the story does not progress any further until the user      solves the puzzle/obstacle/mystery.</li>
<li><strong>External/ontological      interactivity:</strong> In this category the user is outside of the virtual      world, but has some control over the story and the fates of the      characters, such that the story is generated directly through the user&#8217;s      decisions. Typically in this case, because the user is external to the      narrative, &#8220;the individual forking paths in the plot are&#8230; less      interesting than the global pattern of their interconnections&#8221; (Ryan,      2001). Computer games that follow the god approach to user interactivty      usually fall into this category (ex. <em>Black      &amp; White, SimCity, the Sims, Caesar</em>), where the user plays an      omnipotent being controlling the world&#8217;s destiny. Most (if not all) of      these games attempt to immerse the user a little more by giving them a      role to play in the game. For example in <em>Caesar</em> you play a Roman Emperor governing your city, in <em>SimCity</em> you are the mayor. In <em>Black &amp; White</em> you are a god      fighting for power against other gods in the same world as you. This      internalization of the user&#8217;s role places these games somewhere between      external/ontological and internal/ontological.<strong> </strong></li>
<li><strong>Internal/ontological      interactivity:</strong> In this category the user is internal to the narrative,      and has the ability to control their own fate by making decisions      according to the laws of time and space of the virtual world. If the      Holodeck of the Star Trek universe was ever to be implemented, this is the      category under which it would fall. This category is actually quite broad,      however, as the series of <em>Choose-Your-Own-Adventure</em> books that were      popular a few years back is also an example of this type of interactivity.      Reading these books, the user flips through the first-person text to      follow a branching-type narrative, and ultimately governs the path that      they will take through the different narrative possibilities. A good example      of this type of interactivity that is popular today is the Massive      Multi-Player Online Game (MMOG), where thousands of players interact over      the internet in a shared virtual world. Players are actual characters      (represented by avatars) who travel around and explore the fictional      realm, and who can either choose to follow the inherent storyline      established by the game creators, or diverge from this and create their      own set of goals and activities, thereby creating a completely generative      narrative. In one MMOG, a group of players got together and instead of      following the established game quests, decided to create their own club      (actually called a guild) with no other purpose than to socialize with      each other. For these people, the narrative experience emerged from their      own interactions and relationships.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe that Ryan&#8217;s four categories of interactivity are very useful, although I do have a problem with her treatment of ontological interactivity. According to Ryan&#8217;s framework, a branching-type narrative that has a fixed, and often quite limited, number of possible paths can be in the same category as the Holodeck model, where the experience is completely generated through user interaction, and there are no fixed traversals through the narrative content. For this reason I believe that <em>ontological interactivity</em> needs to be broken down ever further, into <strong>embedded ontological interactivity</strong> and <strong>emergent ontological interactivity </strong>(borrowing from Eric Zimmerman’s terms). Under this framework a <em>Choose-Your-Own-Adventure</em> book would be an example of <em>internal/embedded ontological interactivity</em>, and a Massive Multi-Player Online Game would be an example of <em>internal/emergent ontological interactivity</em>. An example of <em>external/emergent ontological interactivity</em> would be games like the <em>Sims</em>, <em>SimCity</em>, and any other god-game that has a virtually unlimited number of possible narrative paths.</p>
