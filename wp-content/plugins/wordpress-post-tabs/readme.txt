== Usage ==

**Option 1 - Quick Tag**

* Use Quick Tags to get the plugin shortcode in the post/page content area. Fill the Quick Tag box with name of tabs (commna separated) and click on 'Insert' button. It will insert shortcode with default tab content, you can edit the content in the same edit panel of post/page.

**Option 2 - Manual Insertion of Shortcode**

* To insert the tabs, you would need to use two shortcodes on your Edit Post/Page admin panel. The first shortcode is for tab names and the second shortcode represents the end of the set of the tabs. You can insert multiple number of tabset on a single page.
* Example how to put tabs:


`[wptab name='Overview']

This is the overview section.

[/wptab]

[wptab name='Specifications']

Various product Specifications can be entered here.

[/wptab]

[wptab name='Screenshots']

You can insert images or screenshots of the product. 

[/wptab]

[end_wptabset]`

**Do not forget to insert the 'name' attribute for each tab. It is important** 

** Just remember to put the 'end_tabset' shortcode at the end of all tab contents as shown above.**

* On the 'Post/Page Tabs' Settings on your WordPress admin, you can select your style. Currently there are three styles - default, gray and red. You can add your own styles easily. Please refer the plugin page how to add the custom styles, its just 2 minute work.

* In case you wish to reload the page every time another tab is clicked, you can select that option from the settings page. This would be helpful if you wish to count these pageviews as well.

* If you check the 'Disable loading on all Posts' option, this will disable the plugin on the posts all together and you will get a custom box 'Enable Post/Page Tabs Feature' on your Edit Post panel. Now you can check this checkbox for those posts only where you wish to enable the tabs. This will prevent the loading of the script and style specific to this plugin on all other pages.

* Same as above is the case with 'Disable loading on all Pages', its for pages.

* You can replace the default shortcodes with your own, that are comfortable for you.
