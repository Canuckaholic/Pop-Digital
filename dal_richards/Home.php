<h1 class="ContentTitle">Dal Richards and his Orchestra</h1>

<p class="ContentP">For more than seven decades, Dal Richards & his Orchestra have delighted Canadian with memorable dance music. This past New Year's Eve December 31, 2006, Dal performed at his 72nd consecutive New Year's party - doing what comes naturally - playing a swinging New Year's Eve show for a dance floor full of happy fans at Richmond's River Rock Casino Resort.
</p>
<p class="ContentP">
A Vancouver legend, Dal continues to swing - leading his orchestra of talented musicians in a blend of unique sounds that capture the best of the big band era, along with jazz, rock and pop standards from the 1930s to today. He's played small towns and big cities throughout the province - and continues to bring his unique sound to British Columbians from White Rock to Whistler, New Westminster to Inuvik and beyond.

<p class="ContentP"><em>&ldquo;With much has changed in the entertainment business in the last half-century, audiences continue to enjoy the swinging sounds of big band music, and, as long as the audiences keep coming, I will continue to lead the band.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="ContentP">Dal, with his big band orchestra, swinging dance band or combo, is still taking bookings for special events, galas, weddings, birthday, anniversaries, concerts, reunions and dances for years to come - with a long-term goal of entertaining at the 2010 Olympics.
