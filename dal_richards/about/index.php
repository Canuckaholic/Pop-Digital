	<div class="largeTextTitle">About Dal</div>
<p>When most men his age are either no longer with us or sitting in an easy chair reminiscing about their youth, ninety-one-year old Vancouver bandleader Dal Richards is still busy playing gigs all over the province.   After seventy-four-plus years in the business Dal is still one of the busiest musicians in Vancouver... a must-have entertainer for weddings, birthdays, festivals, fund-raising concerts and corporate events.   Whether it's a quartet at a senior's centre, a six-piece band at a wedding, a nine or eleven piece swing band for a convention or his fourteen piece big band at the PNE, Dal's music is always enthusiastically received.  From classic big band numbers from the thirties and forties to rock and roll, dance numbers and pop tunes, the Dal Richards Orchestra plays music for any occasion and all ages.</p>

<p>Dal recently completed production of a new big band CD, a co-production with CBC Radio.  Joined by his regular big band vocalists, Diane Lines, Jamie Croil, Jennifer Hayes and Bria Skonberg and by special guest artist bluesman Jim Byrnes, the CD 'Dal Richards and Friends; One More Time' features great big band swing favourites like St. Louis Blues and Opus One to A Tisket A Tasket and The Nearness of You, as well as an original piece called 'Swinging with Dal' that was written for Dal's 90th Birthday Celebration Concert, January 5th 2008.</p>

<p>Dal's band played at the opening of Vancouver's exciting new Convention Centre, at the Vancouver International Jazz Festival, and – for his 70th consecutive year at the PNE -  serving up two big-band shows a day for the seventeen day run of the Fair.   The next big highlight for Dal is his 75th consecutive New Year's Eve performance….an incredible accomplishment, one likely never to be matched.  Dal and his band will be playing for dancing in the Whistler Ballroom at the River Rock Resort and Casino in Richmond, and long-time fans are already lining up for tickets.  Late last year Dal's popular radio show 'Dal's Place', a staple on the air-waves in Vancouver for more than twenty-five years, moved to AM650, where it airs Sunday nights from 9 till 10pm.   Dal recently completed work on his memoirs with well-known Vancouver writer Jim Taylor – and the book,  titled simply 'Dal Richards, One More Time', is in bookstores now.</p>

Dal a proud recipient of the Order of Canada (1994) and the Order of British Columbia (2003), and was granted the Freedom of the City by Vancouver City Council in 2005.   What's next for Dal?    'I'm still having fun leading the band and entertaining British Columbians', Dal states.  After celebrating his 92nd birthday on January 5th, Dal will continue to train for his participation in the 2010 Olympic Torch Relay as it rolls through Vancouver on February 11th.  He was honoured to be chosen by Mary McNeil, MLA for Vancouver False Creek and the Minister of State responsible for the Olympics and ActNow BC., to represent the citizens of downtown Vancouver on this once-in-a-lifetime occasion.</em>.</p>
