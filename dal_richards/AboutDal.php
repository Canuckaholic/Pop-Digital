<h1 class="ContentTitle">About Dal</h1>


<p class="ContentP">In Western Canada, the great sound of the Big Band era is synonymous with one man - musician and bandleader Dal Richards. </p>

<p class="ContentP">For more than seven decades, the Dal Richards' Orchestra has delighted Canadians with memorable dance music. Just this past New Year's Eve December 31, 2006, Dal celebrated 72 consecutive years bringing in the New Year swinging.</p>

<p class="ContentP">A Vancouver native, Dal Richards established his musical home in Vancouver event before graduating from Magee High School when he formed a band and was entertainment at clubs and dances around Vancouver in the late 1930s. By 1941 he was leading his band at Vancouver's most popular dance venue, the Panorama Roof at the Hotel Vancouver. The Roof and the band became the centre of Vancouver's social scene for more than 25-years and brought as taste of Vancouver night life to Canadians across the country on live CBC broadcasts from the Roof on Saturday nights.</p>

<p class="ContentP">When the big band music business slowed in the late sixties, Dal returned to school and received a Diploma of Technology in Hospitality Management from BCIT. A fifteen-year career in the hotel business in Vancouver followed - but as big band swing music regained popularity in the 1980s, Dal resurrected his Orchestra, and the band and Dan have never been busier.</p>

<p class="ContentP">Dal's music is an important part of many corporate events and conventions, community concerts and special occasions like weddings and anniversaries, birthday and reunions. Dal’s 14-piece big band is featured daily at the Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver, and his Dal Richards' Combo plays regularly at Chantel’s Lounge at the Boulevard Casino in Coquitlam.</p>

<p class="ContentP">Dal has been featured in not one but two national television documentaries. His biography, <em>&ldquo;Big Band Boom&rdquo;</em> won a silver medal for documentaries at the 1990 U.S. International Film and Video Festival in Chicago; while a musical special featuring the Dal Richards Orchestra, <em>&ldquo;What Legends Are Made Of&rdquo;</em> has been broadcast nationally several times on CTV and Bravo.</p>

<p class="ContentP">Even after more than half a century entertaining Canadians, Dal still runs a full-time business booking and performing with the Dal Richards' Orchestra, and hosts a weekly radio show <a href="DalsPlace.php">'Dal's Place'</a> on <b>600 AM Radio</b>. Dal is an active volunteer with the Variety Club, the B. C. Entertainment Hall of Fame and Vancouver AM Tourist Services Association.</p>

<p class="ContentP">Dal has received many honours and accolades during his career including honorary doctorates from both the BC Institute of Technology and Open Learning University recognizing his lifelong commitment to learning, which have led to his friends and fans affectionately called him <em>&ldquo;Dr. Swing&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p class="ContentP">Dal is a popular speaker for numerous events and organizations, talking about his experiences in the music business and the important of life-long learning. He still manages to find time to take courses, because, as Dal epitomized, one is never too old to learn something new.</p>

<p class="ContentP">A Vancouver legend, Dal continues to entertain old and young alike at regular engagements and special occasions around town.</p>
